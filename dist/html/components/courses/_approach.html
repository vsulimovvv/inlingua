              Multiple language fluency is a huge asset for any business or
              team. At inlingua we make sure to undertake an in-depth analysis
              to determine your concrete objectives. This is done by collecting
              your precise needs and setting up a complete and reliable initial
              evaluation, both written and oral. The information collected
              allows for the recommendation of a tailor-made program that will
              fit your needs and lead to your goals.
