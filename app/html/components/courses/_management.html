        At inlingua, maintaining the quality of all our language training
        programmes is of the utmost importance, we therefore make sure that both
        the training programme participants as well as the training managers
        guide the training through their regular input and feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evaluations are carried out regularly during training in order to
        monitor and ensure that the programme is goal-driven.
      </p>

      <p>
        We keep constant communication with all our trainers, course
        participants and your company to allow for a dynamic offer as well as a
        fast and where necessary, efficient adaptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A final evaluation is made in order to measure progress at the end of
        the training. After which a detailed progress report is issued,
        accompanied by advice and recommendations for the next steps.
